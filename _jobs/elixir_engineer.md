We believe in a new decentralized web. Diode is one of the teams building the new decentralized underpinnings of this new web. The Diode Network is a network traffic backbone for a new internet, making it easy to add peer-to-peer capabilities to any application. Diode CLI is the developer's toolchain to interact with this network. And with Diode Drive we're creating a compelling alternative to centralized cloud storage that is as convenient or better and local first! We believe privacy and security will win if it's made easy.

Today Diode Drive runs on Macs, Windows, Linux, and Raspberry Pi's around the globe giving many people the first time access to decentralized technology through an easy-to-use application.
