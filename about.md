### Top Story
story:
  title: We had to walk uphill both ways&hellip;
  heading: The attack surface was too large
  content: |
    Diode was born when co-founder Dominic Letz could not rest until he had solved for a Man in the Middle attack against time - a prerequisite for legacy Web2 PKI-based security (and a problem than had bricked millions of a customer’s devices).
    
    He found a solution by applying decentralized consensus to even the most resource constrained devices.  The Diode team has been innovating ever since to turn the dramatic implications for the future of the Internet into securing today’s most fluid IT environments.
