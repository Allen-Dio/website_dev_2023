  heading: Operational Technology.

    Diode is a robust data fabric for the industrial Internet of Things that can securely expand your OT boundary to give your team highly secure remote access to add new assets or to manage and interact with existing assets in hard-to-reach locations.<br><br>
    
    #### GDPR and Data Compliance
    No matter where your assets are at in the world, Diode’s “self custody” approach to regionality and data compliance means that you set the terms - all without IT setup or maintenance burden.

- title: Integrate in-house and 3rd party systems
  heading: Product Development.
  content: |
    Easily deploy product, model, or network-level security perimeters where all components are explicitly identified and permissioned - whether created and provisioned in-house, or from a valued partner.  If you need Zero Trust security but need to build an ecosystem, Diode could be the ticket.
    
    #### Enterprise Security and Access Control
    It’s easy to support multiple enterprises  and even transition ownership of the perimeters to a new enterprise. If your IT team has a cyber operations requirement, Diode can integrate with existing tools.

- title: Access for stakeholders
  heading: Developer Operations.
  content: |
    Every Devops team has one or more server interfaces or dashboards that are not hardened for exposure to the public Internet. You can use Diode to pipe those interfaces to even non-tech stakeholders without requiring development or any more of your time explaining again how to use a VPN.
    
    #### Perfect for On Premise and Hybrid
    On prem and managed cloud deployments just got a lot easier. Provision the server and ship product - Diode will connect you no matter where it lands.

- title: Protect IP and customer information
  heading: IP and  Content.
  content: |
    Cloud data, email history, and FTP accounts grow, get stale, and become a liability. Diode is an inherently self-custody solution that just works. You can limit your exposure by keeping your IP and sensitive content under your control and just enabling per-customer or per-project secure portals to the information that already exists.
    
    #### HIPAA and Regulated Industries
    If you operated in a regulated industry, Diode can integrate into your organization’s policy framework and allow you and suppliers to continue agile collaborations without the liability of cloud data footprints.
