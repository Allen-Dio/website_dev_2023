    - title: POLICY APPLICATION
      description: |
        This Policy applies to Diode’s collection, use, and disclosure of the personal information of the following categories of data subjects:

        - **Attendees**:
          Those who visit our offices or provide their information to Diode or Diode representatives when 
          they attend or register to attend Diode-sponsored events or other events at which Diode 
          (and/or its representatives) participates, as well as those who participate in Diode’s studies 
          such as user experience research.
        - **Website Visitors**: 
          Those who visit our Websites, including those who may opt to provide an email address or other
          contact information to receive communications from Diode, fill out a survey, or provide feedback.
          For the purposes of this Policy, “Websites” refer collectively to www.diode.io as well as any 
          other websites Diode operates for its own behalf and that link to this Policy. For clarity, 
          “Websites” does not include any sites owned or operated by our Customers, including where we 
          serve as Registrar.
        - **Customers**: 
          Individuals or entities who enter into a subscription agreement with Diode (or its authorized 
          partner) and to whom Diode provides Services pursuant to such agreement. For purposes of this 
          Policy, “Services” shall refer to all of the solutions offered, marketed, or sold by Diode or 
          its authorized partners that are designed to facilitate decentralized communications, along with 
          any software, software development kits, and application programming interfaces ("APIs") made 
          available in connection with the foregoing.
        - **Administrators**: 
          Those with login credentials for a Diode account and/or those who 
          administer any of the Services for a Customer. In some cases, an Administrator and Customer 
          may be the same individual. In other cases, an Administrator may be an agent acting on behalf of 
          a Customer.
        - **End Users**: 
          Those who (i) access or use our Customers’ domains, networks, websites, application 
          programming interfaces, and applications, or (ii) are authorized Diode for Teams users, such 
          as our Customers’ employees, agents, or contractors.
          
        This Policy also does not apply to our Customers’ domains, websites, APIs, applications, and 
        networks, which may have their own terms and privacy policies. Our Customers are solely responsible 
        for establishing policies for and ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, 
        including those relating to the collection of personal information, in connection with the use of 
        our Services by End Users with whom our Customers interact.

        Diode’s Websites and Services are not intended for, nor designed to attract, individuals under the 
        age of eighteen. Diode does not knowingly collect personal information from any person under the 
        age of eighteen.

        When Diode is a reverse proxy, our IP addresses may appear in WHOIS and DNS records for websites 
        using our Services. We are a conduit for information controlled by others. It is our Customers and 
        their users who are responsible for the content transmitted across our network (e.g., images, written 
        content, graphics, etc.).
      
    - title: INFORMATION WE COLLECT (Categories of Data Subjects)
      description: |
        
          - **Attendees**: 
              - **Name, email address, and other contact information**: We may ask for and collect personal 
                information such as your name, address, phone number and email address when you visit our offices,

                We ask for and—at your option—collect personal information from you when you submit web forms on 
                our Websites, including opportunities to sign up for and agree to receive email communications 
                from us. We also may ask you to submit such personal information if you choose to use interactive 
                features of the Websites, including participation in surveys, contests, promotions, sweepstakes, 
                or studies, requesting customer support, submitting feedback, or otherwise communicating with us. 
                We will send such communications in accordance with applicable law.
              - **Log files**: 
                Just as when you visit and interact with most websites and services delivered via 
                the Internet, when you visit our Websites, including the Diode Community Forum, we gather certain 
                information and store it in log files. This information may include but is not limited to Internet
                Protocol (IP) addresses, system configuration information, URLs of referring pages, and locale 
                and language preferences.
              - **Cookies and other tracking technologies**: 
                We may use cookies and other information-gathering technologies for a variety of purposes, such 
                as providing us with information about how you interact with our Websites and assisting us in 
                our marketing efforts. You can control how websites use cookies by configuring your browser's 
                privacy settings (please refer to your browser's help function to learn more about cookie 
                controls). Note that if you disable cookies entirely, Diode’s Websites may not function properly. 
                We may also use cookies and similar technologies to provide you advertising on third-party 
                sites based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish not to have this information 
                used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking here (or 
                if located in the European Union, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland, click here). You may view 
                a complete list of cookies and change your cookie preferences by clicking on the

                about the cookies Diode uses and your privacy choices, please see our Cookie Policy.
              - **Material contributed in Interactive Areas**: 
                The Websites may offer publicly accessible blogs, community forums, comments sections, 
                discussion forums, or other interactive features (“Interactive Areas”). If you choose 
                to participate in any of these Interactive Areas, please be aware that any information 
                that you post in an Interactive Area might be read, collected, and used by others who access 
                it. If you wish to remove your personal information from any of our Interactive Areas, please 
                see the Section 8, below.

          - **Customers and Administrators**:
              - **Customer Account Information**: 
                When you register for an account, we collect contact information. Depending on subscription 
                level, this contact information may include your Customer name, the email address(es) of your
                account Administrator(s), telephone number, and addresses necessary to process payment and
                delivery of Services. In addition, when you use the Services, we collect information about how 
                you configure your account and the Services (e.g., firewall settings for the domains you 
                administer), and we maintain logs of Administrator activity. We refer to all of this information 
                collectively as “Customer Account Information” for the purposes of this Policy. Customer Account 
                Information is required to enable your access to your Diode account and Services. By providing 
                us with any personal information, you represent that you are the owner of such personal 
                information or otherwise have the requisite consent to provide it to us.
              - **Payment information**: 
                We do not require our Customers to have payment information on file with us unless they have 
                a paid subscription to our Services. When you sign up for one of our paid Services, you must 
                provide payment and billing information. The information you will need to submit depends on 
                which payment method you choose. For example, if you pay with a credit card, we will collect 
                your card information and billing address, although we do not store full credit card numbers or 
                personal account numbers.

          - **Public DNS Resolver Users**:
              - **Limited DNS query data**: 
                We will collect limited DNS query data that is sent to our 1.1.1.1 resolver. Our 1.1.1.1 resolver 
                service does not log personal data, and the bulk of the limited non-personally identifiable query 
                data is only stored for 25 hours. You can learn more about our 1.1.1.1 resolver commitment to 
                privacy here.
              - Please note that our data handling practices for our 1.1.1.1 Application, which is not covered by 
                this Policy, are somewhat different than our 1.1.1.1 resolver data handling practices and are described here.

          - **End Users**:
              - **Log Data**: Diode processes End Users’ information on behalf of our Customers. This information 
                is processed when End Users access or use our Customers’ domains, websites, APIs, applications, 
                devices, end points, and networks that use one or more of our Services. Diode also processes 
                End Users’ information on behalf of our Customers when the End Users access our Services 
                pursuant to our Customers’ authorization. The information processed may include but is not 
                limited to IP addresses, system configuration information, and other information about traffic 
                to and from Customers’ websites, devices, applications, and/or networks (collectively, 
                “Log Data”).
          - **Registrants**:
              - **Contact and domain information**: We collect data such as domain name and status, contact 
                information (such as name, organization, address, phone number and email address), name server, 
                DNSSEC, and Form of Approval (i.e., full WHOIS capture at time of transfer into our system, 
                including the IP address that initiated the transfer).
              - In addition, Diode stores server and network activity data, and observations and analyses 
                derived from traffic data collected by Diode in the course of providing the Services (together, 
                “Operational Metrics”). Examples of Operational Metrics include service uptime and service
                availability metrics, request volumes, error rates, cache rates, and IP threat scores.

    - title: HOW WE USE INFORMATION WE COLLECT
      description: |
        Diode only processes personal information in a way that is compatible with and relevant to the purpose

            you with information about products and services, features, surveys, newsletters, offers, promotions, 
            contests, and events about us and our partners; and send other news or information about us and our 
            partners. See Section 9 below for information on managing your communication preferences.
          - Process and deliver contest or sweepstakes entries and rewards;
          - Monitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities in connection with the Websites and Services and 
            for marketing or advertising purposes;
          - Comply with legal obligations as well as to investigate and prevent fraudulent transactions, 
            unauthorized access to the Services, and other illegal activities;
          - Personalize the Websites and Services, including by providing features or content that match your interests 
            and preferences;
          - To register visitors to our offices and to manage non-disclosure agreements that visitors may be 
            required to sign, to the extent such processing is necessary for our legitimate interest in protecting 
            our offices and our confidential information against unauthorized access; and
          - Process for other purposes for which we obtain your consent.
        **Log Data from End Users**. We use and process the Log Data from End Users to fulfill our obligations 
        under our Customer agreements and as may be required by law. We act as a data processor and service 
        provider pursuant to data processing instructions by our Customers.

        **Information from Third Party Services**. We may combine information we collect as described in Section 2 
        above with personal information we obtain from third parties. For example, we may combine information entered 
        on a Diode sales submission form with information we receive from a third-party sales intelligence platform 
        vendor to enhance our ability to market our Services to Customers or potential Customers.

    - title: DATA AGGREGATION
      description: |
        Diode may aggregate data we acquire about our Customers, Administrators, and End Users, including the Log 
        Data described above. For example, we may assemble data to determine how Web crawlers index the Internet 
        and whether they are engaged in malicious activity or to compile web traffic reports and statistics. 
        Non-personally identifiable, aggregated data may be shared with third parties.

    - title: NOTICE TO UK AND EU RESIDENTS
      description: |
        Please note that the “personal information” referenced in this Privacy Policy means “personal data” as that 
        term is defined under the European Union (“EU”) General Data Protection Regulations (“GDPR”) and its United 
        Kingdom (“UK”) GDPR counterpart. Diode is a data controller for the Personal Data collected from all 
        categories of data subjects listed above except for the Personal Data of End Users. Diode processes the 
        Personal Data of End Users on behalf of its Customers.

        If you are an individual from the European Economic Area (the “EEA”), the UK or Switzerland, please note 
        that our legal basis for collecting and using your personal information will depend on the personal information 
        collected and the specific context in which we collect it. We normally will collect personal information 
        from you only where: (a) we have your consent to do so, (b) where we need your personal information to 
        perform a contract with you (e.g. to deliver the Diode Services you have requested), or (c) where the 
        processing is in our legitimate interests. Please note that in most cases, if you do not provide the 
        requested information, Diode will not be able to provide the requested service to you.

        In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you, or may 
        otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person. 
        Where we rely on your consent to process your personal data, you have the right to withdraw or 
        decline consent at any time. Where we rely on our legitimate interests to process your personal data, 
        you have the right to object.

        If you have any questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we 
        collect and use your personal information, please contact us at privacy@diode.io.

    - title: INFORMATION SHARING (prune and limit)
      description: |
        We work with other companies who help us run our business (“Service Providers”). These companies provide 
        services to help us deliver customer support, process credit card payments, manage and contact our existing 
        Customers and Administrators as well as sales leads, provide marketing support, and otherwise operate and 
        improve our Services. These Service Providers may only process personal information pursuant to our 
        instructions and in compliance both with this Privacy Policy and other applicable confidentiality and security 
        measures and regulations, including our obligations under the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield frameworks 
        described in Section 7, below.

        Specifically, we do not permit our Service Providers to sell any personal information we share with them or 
        to use any personal information we share with them for their own marketing purposes or for any purpose other 
        than in connection with the services they provide to us.

        In addition to sharing with Service Providers as described above, we also may share your information with 
        others in the following circumstances:
        
        - Within the Diode Group (defined for the purposes of this Policy as Diode, Inc. (United States) and its 
          subsidiaries listed Section 16;
        - With our resellers and other sales partners who may help us distribute the Services to Customers;
        - With an app developer when you install an app from our App Marketplace;
        - In the event of a merger, sale, change in control, or reorganization of all or part of our business;
        - When we are required to disclose personal information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal 
          process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. (Learn more about 
          how we handle law enforcement requests here);
        - Where we have a good-faith belief sharing is necessary to investigate, prevent or take action regarding 
          illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of 
          any person, or violations of our Website Terms of Use, Self-Serve Subscription Agreement, and/or 
          Enterprise Subscription Terms of Service; or as otherwise required to comply with our legal obligations; or
        - As you may otherwise consent from time to time.

        **Registrants.** If you purchase a domain name from Diode’s registrar service, ICANN (The Internet Corporation 
        for Assigned Names and Numbers) and the relevant registry operators overseeing the domain’s top-level domain 
        require us to collect registrant data for the purposes of domain registration and via the WHOIS protocol. 
        We may also be required to share this public data with ICANN, the relevant registry operators and other 
        such providers with whom we contract in order to provide our domain name services, and additionally upon the 
        legitimate request of third parties. Registrant data may include the domain name, registrant name and other 
        contact information, and domain name server information. See our Domain Registration Agreement here.

        **Notice to California Residents.** We do not sell, rent, or share personal information with third parties 
        as defined under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (California Civil Code Sec. 1798.100 et seq.), 
        nor do we sell, rent, or share personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes 
        as defined under California Civil Code Sec. 1798.83.

    - title: INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION TRANSFERS
      description: |
        Diode is a U.S.-based, global company. We primarily store your information, if any, in the United States and 
        the European Economic Area. To facilitate our global operations, we may transfer and access such information 
        from around the world, including from other countries in which the Diode Group has operations for the purposes 
        described in this Policy.

        Whenever Diode shares personal information originating in the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland with a Diode 
        entity outside the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland, we will do so on the basis of the EU standard contractual 
        clauses (adjusted to address transfers from the UK).

        If you are accessing or using our Websites or Services or otherwise providing information to us, we may 
        transfer your personal information outside of the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland, ensuring appropriate 
        safeguards are in place to protect your personal information. We describe our additional safeguards here. 
        If you have any questions about or need further information concerning the appropriate safeguards Diode has 
        in place to protect your personal information, please contact us at privacy@diode.io.

    - title: DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS AND CHOICES
      description: |
        For any subject access request ("SAR"), we will need to verify a requestor is inquiring about their own
        information before we can assist. Where a SAR may implicate the personal data of another individual, we 
        must balance the request against the risk of violating another person’s privacy rights. We will comply 
        with SARs to the extent required by applicable law. In the EEA, the UK, and Switzerland, you also have the 
        right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.

        Attendees, Website Visitors, Customers, Administrators, and Registrants. You have the right to access, 
        correct, update, export, or delete your personal information. You may email us at privacy@diode.io with 
        any such subject access requests (“SAR”), and we will respond within thirty (30) days. Customers and 
        Administrators also can access, correct, export, or update their Account Information by editing their 
        profile or organization record at diode.io.

        Public DNS Resolver Users. We do not retain any personal information about 1.1.1.1 resolver users that 
        would be subject to the data subject rights described above.

        End Users. Diode has no direct relationship with End Users. Even where “Diode” may be indicated as the 
        authoritative name server for a domain, unless Diode is the owner of that domain or peer, we have no 
        control over a domain or peer’s content. Accordingly, we rely upon our Customers to comply with the 
        underlying legal requirements for subject access requests. If an End User requests that we access, 
        correct, update, or delete their information, or no longer wishes to be contacted by one of our Customers 
        that use our Services, we will direct that End User to contact the Customer website(s) with which they 
        interacted directly. Our Customers are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable 
        laws and regulations with respect to their website users.

    - title: COMMUNICATION PREFERENCES
      description: |
        Diode may send you commercial communications based on the communication preferences you configure. Diode 
        may also send you service-related communications.  You may unsubscribe to any communication at any time by 
        selecting the “unsubscribe” link in a given communication, or by contacting us directly at unsubscribe@diode.io.

    - title: DATA SECURITY, DATA INTEGRITY AND ACCESS
      description: |
        We take all reasonable steps to protect information we receive from you from loss, misuse or unauthorized 
        access, disclosure, alteration and/or destruction. We have put in place appropriate physical, technical 
        and administrative measures to safeguard and secure your information, and we make use of privacy-enhancing 
        technologies such as encryption. If you have any questions about the security of your personal information, 
        you can contact us at privacy@diode.io.

    - title: NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES
      description: |
        If we make changes to this Policy that we believe materially impact the privacy of your personal 
        information, we will promptly provide notice of any such changes (and, where necessary, obtain consent), 
        as well as post the updated Policy on this website noting the effective date of any changes.

    - title: BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS
      description: |
        We may assign or transfer this Policy, as well as information covered by this Policy, in the event of 
        a merger, sale, change in control, or reorganization of all or part of our business.

    - title: ENGLISH LANGUAGE CONTROLS
