Industry experts view data as the [“new oil”](https://www.vansonbourne.com/StateOfIT2018Reports/internet-of-things). Industry participants are beginning to understand that parsing and making sense of the vast amount of information collected by the [Industrial IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things#Industrial_applications) (Internet Of Things) is now a necessity. Yet, a recent [survey](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181009005649/en/New-Independent-Study-Reveals-Current-State-Internet) found that 90% of the IoT projects planned for Fortune 2000 enterprises are stalled.

According to that same survey, some of the largest barriers to implementation of IoT projects are lack of internal expertise and skills (31%), inability to manage and process large volumes of data (29%), integration issues (28%), too many legacy systems (28%), inability to scale the network to meet IoT demands (26%) and cybersecurity challenges (25%).

[Exosite LLC](https://exosite.com/), an IoT software as a service company headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota, is planning a bold move to tear down these barriers.

Exosite is planning to launch a revolutionary new platform called “Diode” to address the security, complexity and scalability challenges that are currently restricting even the most innovative enterprises from getting the most out of their sensor data.

Diode, the platform, is named after the silicon component by the same name that is found in modern computer chips. Diodes enable one way binary communication which became the foundation for the Information Age. Similarly, Diode the platform will join the physical world with the digital world in ways that were impossible before which will lay the foundation for the next digital revolution.

In a sense, Diode has been in the works for over a decade. Exosite is best known for its practical experience building robust IoT platforms and custom vertical solutions for its industrial IoT partners. However, Exosite also has a track record of developing valuable patents and being first to market with technologies that end customers rarely come in contact with. So, it should come as no surprise that in the development of Diode, Exosite has laid claim to intellectual property in yet another disruptive technology, [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain).

Many may recognize blockchain as the technology powering Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. However, some may not be aware of the unique properties blockchains share that make them extremely useful for establishing and proving digital identities.

Blockchains are essentially shared ledgers and databases in which everyone on the network has a copy. Transactions are recorded in a way that is easy to authenticate but very difficult to counterfeit.

When blockchains are specifically configured for IoT devices they become tremendously powerful shared layers of data. These shared layers of data can be used to identify and track the ownership of assets and data across trust boundaries.

To illustrate just one very simple example, take for instance the concept of the digital twin[^twin]. The digital twin has allowed customers to visualize digital representations of their device and track the changes to their devices’ physical states in real time. 

While this was definitely an incredible innovation for the time, the implications for this technology are capped by the customer’s ability to trust the data received. Even relatively mundane use cases like production optimization and predictive maintenance are severely impaired if the data has the potential to be compromised or stolen. Customers can forget about exploring solutions that will enable surgeons to operate on patients from different continents or solving for how commercial satellites can be repaired from the Earth’s surface.

Diode takes the digital twin concept to the next level by allowing users to experience the reality of their devices digitally. In its current state, a digital twin can be copied, the data can be manipulated and the customers’ device identity can be stolen. 

When the data layer is secured by Exosite’s patented blockchain technology, users can be assured that their data are correct, generated by a trusted device and won’t end up in the wrong hands.

The digital twin is only one simple example of how Diode can unlock the future for Blockchain and the Internet of Things. For more, follow Diode on Twitter, join the conversation on Telegram and let’s shape next digital revolution together.

[^twin]: Gartner defines a digital twin as “a dynamic software model of a physical thing or system that relies on sensor data to understand its state, respond to changes, improve operations and add value.” ["Technologies Underpin the Hype Cycle for the Internet of Things, 2016"](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/7-technologies-underpin-the-hype-cycle-for-the-internet-of-things-2016/)
