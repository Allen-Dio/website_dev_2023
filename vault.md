    The Diode Vault is a little box that extends the presence and reach of your team. Plug it into power and Ethernet in a secure location and it will extend the reach of your E2EE collaboration zones.
  
    It relays encrypted messages on behalf of offline team members, backs up files, and provides a private exit node to give your team ex-region Internet access.
